## What is an AI Headshot Generator?

An **AI headshot generator** is artificial intelligence software that transforms ordinary selfies into professional, studio-quality profile photos. Using advanced machine learning, these tools analyze your facial features, apply professional lighting, clean backgrounds, and appropriate attire—delivering results that rival expensive photography sessions.

**Shotly AI** is the fastest AI headshot generator available, producing professional headshots in **under 60 seconds** from just **one photo upload**.

### How AI Headshot Technology Works

1. **Upload** → You provide a single clear selfie
2. **AI Analysis** → Machine learning maps your facial structure, skin tone, and features
3. **Generation** → AI applies professional lighting, backgrounds, and styling
4. **Download** → Receive high-resolution, print-ready headshots instantly

Unlike traditional AI tools requiring model training, Shotly AI uses **instant-inference technology**—no waiting, no failed generations.
